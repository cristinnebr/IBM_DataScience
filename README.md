# IBM_DataScience

labs from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate
https://www.coursera.org/

The specialization has 10 courses, and in each course, we have a practical activity where we have to apply what we learned in the corresponding course.

1. The notebook 'DataScienceEcosystem' summarises tools and ecosystems for data science.
2. In the notebook 'Final_Assessment_Analyzing_Hitorical_Stock_Revenue_and_Building_a_Dashboard, I extract financial data using yfinance and Webscraping, and visualize them in a plot.
